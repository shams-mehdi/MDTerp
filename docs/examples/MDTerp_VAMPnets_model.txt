## For complicated saved models (e.g., created and saved using PyTorch), load them inside load_model().
## Make all changes within the two following function definitions
def load_model(): ## Do not change this line
    import torch
    model = torch.load('./docs/examples/VAMPNets_model', weights_only = False)
    return model

def run_model(model, data): ## Do not change this line
    state_probabilities = model.transform(data)

    return state_probabilities ## Must return state prediction probabilities
